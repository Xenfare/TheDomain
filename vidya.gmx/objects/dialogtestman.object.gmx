I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.")

dialog_add_text(dialog,spr_testportrait,"Test Man","Anne sighed as she sat in her room, staring at her wall. She just finished writing in her diary, and had nothing to do. Life was boring in the Secret Annex, but it was better than the alternative. It was alright talking to Peter and Margot, but they were both such quiet people, unlike the always active Anne. All of a sudden, a flash of light appeared in the room! Anne jumped back, stifling a scream. Before she could run out the closed door she noticed that the person who appeared in the flash was not a Nazi officer, but someone who she had never seen before! His clothes were very strange, and his hair was in a spiky style that was totally new to her. She stood against the wall, wary of the stranger, but he walked towards her and smiled, extending a hand. 'My name is Goku.' The mysterious stranger said. Anne nervously put her hand in his. He bent down and kissed it softly, then let go. Anne blushed, feeling something she had never felt before go off inside of her. 'My name is Anne...' she replied quietly. 'I'm sorry for what just happened,' Goku told her, 'But I was caught in a time portal and deposited here! My power cells will recharge soon, but until then, I'm stuck here.' Anne had no idea what the handsome visitor was talking about, but she played along. 'Well, sir' she said. 'You may stay in my room as long as you like!' Anne blushed again as she said this, and giggled slightly. Goku looked around, and then sat on the bed. 'Thank you for the invitation. I'll be sure to repay you for it soon.' Anne did not understand what he meant by that, however, when he spoke, she felt a warmth deep inside of her. She sat by him on the bed, staring at the man's beautiful eyes. Finally, she could stand it no longer. Anne leaned over and kissed the stranger on the cheek, and then pulled back quickly, not sure of what she had done. 'I'm sorry...' she said, as she stumbled to find the right words. The visitor smirked. 'No, that's quite alright.' He replied with a smile, putting one arm around her. 'You know, you're a very beautiful girl, but I... well...' Anne looked at him, troubled. 'What's the matter?' she said, with a sweet smile. Goku looked nervous. 'I... I'm already married.' he finally managed to choke out. Anne pulled away from him abruptly. 'No!' she said loudly, almost in tears. 'I'm sorry...' he replied. Anne was furious. 'Nothing ever goes right!' she cried out. 'I have to go now, my power cells have recharged.' said Goku. Anne was in tears by now, staring at the wall so she wouldn't see Goku's face. He smiled a sad smile, and disappeared in another flash, out of Anne's life forever. Anne never forgot him, though... not until the end of time.")
